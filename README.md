### PROBLEM
A firewall alone doesnâ€™t provide adequate protection against modern cyber threats. Malware and other malicious content are often delivered using legitimate types of traffic, such as email, or web traffic. In order to solve this problem we need to step in further and examine the network traffic, this is where the Intrusion Detection System plays a major role.
<br><br><br>


### WHAT IS IDS?
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a network security technology originally built for detecting vulnerability exploits against a target application or computer. The IDS is a listen-only device. The IDS monitors traffic and reports results to an administrator.
<br><br><br>


### WORKING OF IDS

![ids](https://github.com/raghavtwenty/ids-prediction/assets/126254197/a3e59d1c-b33c-44d7-ae89-147663b38591)

Typical intrusion detection systems look for known attack, Signature-based IDS monitors inbound network traffic, looking for specific patterns and sequences that match known attack signatures or abnormal deviations from set norms. These anomalous patterns in the network traffic are then sent up in the stack for further investigation at the protocol and application layers of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model.<br>
<br> An IDS is placed out of the real-time communication band (a path between the information sender and receiver) within your network infrastructure to work as a detection system. It instead leverages a SPAN or TAP port for network monitoring and analyzes a copy of inline network packets (fetched through port mirroring) to make sure the streaming traffic is not malicious or spoofed in any way. The IDS efficiently detects infected elements with the potential to impact your overall network performance, such as malformed information packets, DNS poisonings, port scans and more.<br>
IDS is either installed on your network or a client system (host-based IDS)
<br><br><br>


### OBJECTIVE
To predict the type of cyber attack that could have possibly occurred in a network. Having the past network logs from a server using machine learning models, We have to choose the best suitable model for the prediction. For the new input classify the type of cyber attack that has a higher chance of occurence.

### FUTURE SCOPE
Companies realize the limitations of a standard IDS. Some are reacting to build bigger and better products for their customers. New IDS solutions may come with a lower administrative burden. They may rely on machine learning to lower the risk of false positives, So staff have less to examine every day and vendors may update them simultaneously, So the system always has access to up-to-date information in real time.
